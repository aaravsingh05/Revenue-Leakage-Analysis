# Revenue-Leakage-Analysis

This project dives deep into Revenue Leakage — the gap between what you should earn and what you actually get.

Using Python, I explored a dataset of subscription plans, billing records, and customer activity to uncover:

1. Billing inefficiencies
2. Losses from churned customers
3. Excessive or mismanaged discounts
4. Overall leakage impact on revenue

# Objectives

1. Quantify total expected vs. actual revenue
2. Identify key leakage sources (billing, discounts, churn)
3. Measure financial impact of inefficiencies
4. Provide actionable recommendations for revenue optimization

# Dataset Features

user_id – Unique identifier for each customer
plan_type – Type of subscription plan (e.g., Basic, Premium)
start_date / end_date – Subscription period
monthly_fee – Planned monthly charge
actual_usage – Customer’s usage metric
billed_amount – Actual billed value
discount – Discount applied (if any)
status – Active, Churned, or Cancelled

# Key Metrics (KPIs)

1. Total Expected Revenue: Baseline earnings if everything went as planned
2. Total Billed Amount:	What was actually billed
3. Total Revenue Leakage: The financial gap that needs addressing
4. Average Billing Efficiency: Shows how well expected revenue converts into actual billing
5. Churn Rate: Lost customers = lost recurring revenue
6. Count of Discounted Customers: Volume of customers receiving reduced rates
7. Total Discount Leakage Amount: Revenue lost due to excessive discounts

# Findings & Insights

1. Revenue leakage is 16% of total expected revenue.
2. Billing efficiency (83%) needs improvement — potential automation gaps.
3. Churn rate of 8% indicates retention strategies need strengthening.
4. Discount-related leakage accounts for ₹785k — excessive or poorly targeted discounts can erode margins.

# Recommendations

1. Improve Billing Accuracy – Automate invoice validation to close billing gaps.
2. Review Discount Policy – Limit unnecessary discounts, especially for low-usage customers.
3. Reduce Churn – Implement retention offers or usage incentives for at-risk customers.
4. Track KPIs Regularly – Monitor leakage metrics monthly to catch issues early.

# Conclusions & Next Steps

This analysis shows that small inefficiencies add up — ₹6.4M in leakage is a wake-up call.
By improving billing processes, refining discount policies, and focusing on retention, the business can recover a substantial portion of lost revenue.

# Next Steps:

1. Implement recommendations and monitor their financial impact.
2. Extend analysis to forecast leakage under different scenarios.
3. Integrate a real-time leakage dashboard for proactive management.
